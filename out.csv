/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham215.txt,ham, about two months ago i posted a query which somewhat abbreviated ran as follows for some time i have been puzzled by a claim that i come across frequently in the formal grammatical literature namely that since grammatical relations are derived therefore they cannot be referred to by the grammar more specifically my puzzlement is not concerned with why some people believe both that grammatical relations are derived and that grammatical relations cannot be referred to by the grammar but rather with why they think the second belief follows necessarily from the first i would be grateful for any enlightenment on this issue my query did elicit a vast number of responses so maybe i should conclude that people are really interested in this issue but for those who might be interested i will summarize the responses first no one defended the position that i criticized indeed the general tenor explicit or implicit of the responses is that the position is erroneous i am thus inclined to continue believing that it is an error that has unfortunately crept into the literature one which i hope will disappear some people pointed to other specific examples in linguistics and other sciences where derived notions play a crucial role making it meaningful to argue about what are the correct derived notions second some people suggested that those who appear to make the claim in question might really be trying to say something different e g simply that the grammar should not refer directly to grammatical relations but examination of the two most recent instances that i encountered and which prompted me to post the query shows that they only make sense if the claim is interpreted literally as i suggested third some people asked me to cite references to where the claim is made i prefer not to do so it is my aim to embarrass anyone in front of the whole list there are others who are much better at that than i am it would be unfair to the authors of the two instances that i encountered most recently and which i remember i do see why i should cite them especially as they are linguists whose work i respect while those i happen not to remember go uncited i will be happy if the erroneous claim does appear in future i am grateful to the following for their responses dan finer f lehman adam meyers fritz newmeyer sebastian shaumyan jean roger vergnaud bernard comrie comrie bcf usc edu bernard comrie dept of linguistics tel university of southern california fax los angeles ca usa comrie bcf usc edu

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham068.txt,ham, I have translated the article in full see end of post think that done a far better job than the Google translation at least readable now any corrections Stuff in is my additions to the My apologies if paraphrased anybody I will be glad to retract if anyone is The article makes four main Absence of critical In this the idea is that the licence is invalid because it specify under what law the GPL is Specification in English That for the end user opposed to the GPL apply because not written in Arbitary licence The point here is that French the author can change the terms of the licence This is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how to dates and In the absence of such the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a David Neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all not my French law allows a GPL type licence that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear if they are there is nothing to stop the original author taking back The lawyers see this as a weakness in the Hidden this clause means that the liable for any defects if the consumer is not an IT so if Linux blows up and data is then the authors are Ciaran Johnson says that and others have similar clauses the point here is that they are invalid just that this one affects the GPL Niall makes the point that it is not a but rather a arrangement and why it come under this I would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software if no money changes as governed very much by consumer law France Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified under French The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto There may be other reasons under French law why the GPL may be Whole is worth more than these imperfect Specialised lawyers look at the Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky appointed to the and the jurist Vincent both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the licences and in particular the They have published their study in the review intellectuelles and their conclusion is Their approach is The problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under French law them the question is a moot but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free and in particular the The problem is not free but rather the licence contracts of free Absence of critical The authors tell us that first of the reference to is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the The idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to This is under international it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring American The authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public Specification in the English the authors remind us that least in no clause in a contract may be contrary to French law it turns out that a licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law in several it is written in English and the FSF officially approve The obliges this sort of contract to be written in including for businesses since the notion of applies not only to but also to professionals Contacted by the editors of lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared as far as business is the is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of European directives on the but whatever about the problem is still valid for and while waiting for it to French companies have to deal with since it is the law of the A programme under the GPL can suddenly change Another much more is that according to French the author of a free programme at any invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the In the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act the and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its and also with respect to its location where such rights may be and duration of any such This is not the case of the GPL nor of other free this means that in or elsewhere if the author is that which is under the GPL could revert to proprietary from one day to the The problem of the guarantee An other very serious flaw is that of the The GPL licences and others show that the software is delivered You are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence and this is whatever is written in a licence one cannot free oneself from the from hidden since it is imposed in the Civil This concept is poorly understood by the it protects the buyer it may individual or since it specifies the Civil Code and not consumer protection against hidden deliberate or made in good faith by the For if one buys a pair of socks in a and the shop has a notice specifying that items are neither refunded nor and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in several scenarios are You could have checked the socks before the flaw is deemed and you can sing for your You check the socks were packaged for and in this despite the notice refund nor you may invoke and have them changed or obtain a up to I have already invoked in shops the clause and it always worked well are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the Civil The concept of hidden defect is rather it is necessary that you the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then to the Civil that you have bought it at that price if you had known about the The third case which is much rarer is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect but inform In this not only does he have to reimburse the but all expenses incurred by the sale tickets to go to the the fuse which blew when you plugged it in This idea of applies to all including This was made abundantly clear by the authorities the surrounding This is particularly inconvenient for free since a site which offers a Linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if in the case of a free one could speak about a defect since the source code was he replied concerning the the question of obvious defect will This analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an IT professional or OpenSource has this advantage over the proprietary it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an IT for distribution to the public at the problem remains the Roughly Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be During this we asked for about the fragility of the GPL clause which forbids linking source code under the GPL with proprietary In the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another If for I need to link with a proprietary library device I may consider as and this clause of the The conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the merits more than these shoddy which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this Une publication de de recherche en Juillet Une telle clause de contrat qui est ce que dit la Loi est en terme juridique de

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham222.txt,ham, last thursday night may zellig harris died in his sleep after a pleasant working day he was years old he was born in in byelorussia i am told that he chose the name zellig sabbettai when his family immigrated to the united states when he was four i like to think that the semantics of happiness and steadfastness were on his mind certainly they were keynotes of his life i would guess that his parents chose the name harris when he died he was just finishing a book on politics that he had been planning for most of his life with the publication of his book a theory of language and information oxford he had wrapped up his life work on language at least for the time being he seems to have felt at liberty to take up this other unfinished business i understand from paul mattick jr who was harris friend and neighbor for many years in new york that this last book describes how to get from capitalism to socialism this is surely not a conventional take on either capitalism or socialism harris was an anarchist oxford was interested in publishing it and he had also talked with cambridge there is no memorial planned beyond something very private for his family however there is some discussion beginning of a public meeting with scientific content i would hope that the festschrift that haj ross called for in the lsa meetings some years ago might at last come into being harris described himself as a methodologist rather than a linguist this could be misleading he always said that his work was not part of linguistics as it is institutionally defined and that linguists would not be interested in his work though people interested in language would be nonetheless he was surely a linguist by most of the operational definitions one might come up with he had done extensive fieldwork on a variety of language when he was doing the final revision of the oxford book he undertook to test the theory of language against every language of which he had some control languages he spent months reading grammars from morning to night and evaluating whether his theory had a reasonable account for what he found there he was clear that no scientific conclusions were warranted and so no particular notice of this check is given in the book but he wanted to feel reasonably secure that his conclusions were not idiosyncratic to english french german korean and the few other languages that had been the primary bases for their development he was pleased with the results his contributions to the field were numerous and weighty he founded the first linguistics department in the u s he introduced the algebraic representations and abstract mathematical treatment which have become so much norms of the field that it is difficult now to appreciate how much he did so over the kicking and screaming protests of his peers he invented x bar notation for immediate constituent analysis though of course not by that name to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the relation he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once he invented string analysis as a complement not rival to immediate constituent analysis their complementarity with respect to the problem is the basis of joshi tree adjoining grammars tags he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today and in other fields obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar operator grammar based on word dependency discourse analysis for information content and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics for example string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts applied there mainly to medical informatics stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts based on operator grammar successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him he knew that his work was of lasting importance and treated it as such but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers and would not accept any such role being projected onto him those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed however he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment he did not provide such entree nor did he pretend to and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field once in my role as ta for john fought i prepared a lecture on harris approach to syntax and semantics as we were setting out for the lecture hall we encountered harris and i blurted out i m about to give a lecture on your theory to john class john with characteristic wry humor asked if he wanted to take anything back harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing nonetheless when he gave a public lecture on the two structures of language report and paraphrase in or the large auditorium i think it was in the furness building was filled to capacity and the critique by john corcoran published later in the volume transformationelle analyse edited by senta ploetz was also well attended broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his had he chosen it that is simply not where his ambitions lay a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position many years ago do invite anybody over for dinner he said and do accept any invitations if you get involved in the social life of an academic you be able to get any work done the work came first harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family the consequences when combined with his anarchism were not always happy his friend and close colleague of many years henry hiz was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution the disparity of character could be devastating to students i studied with harris from through i was an undergraduate much of that time but that did not matter to him he had a swim approach like that attributed to sapir darnell except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of say athabaskan he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on when i started with him this was the work that resulted in his book mathematical structures of language wiley the process was not a lecture or monologue but a continuing conversation with his students trying out alternatives posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language after a while with intensive reading outside one began to catch on and to participate i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory this troubled him not a bit i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach i had lived in greece for a couple of years and spoke the language but i worked with an informant for this project when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge he merely thanked me for the data on greek a year or two later i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis much as martha evens and now others have done although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work he said and this is an exact quote others have tried this and have failed but you are welcome to try i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz never with harris i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work i think it did not matter to him he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics maybe his attitude differed in the when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as methods in structural linguistics btw the title was to have said descriptive but the publisher substituted the buzzword structural i recall him saying amusedly i do remember whether they asked me or not maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky followers began making him out to be the bad guy i do think so based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the transformational revolution there is a passage in the state of the art in which hockett attributes to harris nothing or a long silence after showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis for which he might be excused but even ignoring the paper transformational theory prominently published in language i showed this passage to harris and he shrugged it did not matter in particular i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky ambitions in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him for example it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the international congress a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero now an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris he accomplished what he intended to quite well thank you very much and seems to have been quite happy in the process the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work and uncomprehending misconstruals abound frawley review of a grammar of english on mathematical principles gemp is a good example he identifies harris operator grammar with predicate calculus though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language a fortiori operator grammar and mathematical systems including predicate calculus frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do generative grammar in because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris work on its own terms another review eric wheeler in computers in the humanities asserted that harris grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems middle voice the semantics of find vs seek and quantifier scope in examples like someone was opposed by everyone in my review computational linguistics in i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book michael kac in his review of harris selected writings asked why bother and indeed from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see having these writings in one place how consistent and self coherent harris program has been over the years transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution i will mention only one other misconception about harris work not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim jim mccawley witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined when methods was published linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions now discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy this has colored perceptions of harris intentions and results for harris it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next but this was a corroborative byproduct not an aim the constructional procedure described in the paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early and proven to work and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible in particular he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants one had to control the language oneself and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form a lengthy and demanding process as probably most of us know from experience so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus turning a crank and having a grammar reel out the other end in the introduction to methods in structural linguistics harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language hunches guesses heuristic rules of thumb typological generalizations proposed universals comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language and so on more art than science or rather more art than engineering harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples language is after all a social institution continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses but to verify for any given result whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language of those who have actually read the book how many have said and some have in fact said to me he did really mean that but if nothing else harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris later work this is a critical point for linguistics for any other science there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience in particular practitioners in physics chemistry even in mathematics rely on the background vernacular of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions however reached to the observations on which they are based not so for a science of language harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language and observably each language contains its own metalanguage i ll repeat that because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about and because it is easy to overlook its importance there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language by contrast generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage external to language that is part of one biological endowment i personally do not find this biologicist neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in why phonology is natural one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than years intuitively we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language say in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples what harris found was how this messy inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a domain such as a science subfield and a system of reductions that changes word shapes often to zero motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning but without destroying that correlation given that structure differences of form correlates with meaning it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language harris endeavor was always then to determine a least grammar a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language harris chose not to make such a critique when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory he would only comment with evidence of mild amusement that it did seem to be like his teacher sapir harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language a paper on this appeared in a volume on avoiding world war iii remember wwiii everyone and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science this culminated in the form of information in science analysis of an immunology sublanguage with michael gottfried tom ryckman and others john benjamins this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists perceptions in the domain of their science a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one to which members give their assets and income and which in turn supports them in their needs i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street until his retirement he held an endowed chair at penn the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf nimh and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem and had been albert einstein assistant at princeton a brother was an immunologist he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the book he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science and would not participate in it that too would be a distraction from the work after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him he mentioned poetry especially the longer works of century poets like browning he mentioned music and he mentioned sign language he had a long and very productive life he had brought his life work to a successful culmination with the completion of his book on politics i imagine death coming to him as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal and him saying ok i m ready now it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him he is an abiding inspiration bruce nevin bn bbn com

Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal The Honorable Michael Powell Chairman Federal Communications Commission Suite DC BY ELECTRONIC AND POSTAL MAIL Dear Chairman I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television Broadcast I write in response to and Representatives Dingell and letters of July which urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a organization that works to uphold civil liberties interests in technology policy and EFF has played a critical role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to the Internet and consumer electronics defeating the restriction on strong cryptography securing the legal principle that Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a and defending researchers and commercial interests against EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion We attended the meetings and conference calls and participated in the policy and technical EFF also maintains a that was and is the only public source of information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and The site can be found at EFF devoted thousands of to publicizing the existence and nature of the BPDG to the to civil liberties and and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose products were threatened by the When you and I met at Esther PC Forum last we spoke briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined by the Broadcast Protection Discussion The BPDG proposal will have grave consequences for free competition and consumer Worst of it will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV compromising DTV adoption As you are technologists have traditionally manufactured those devices they believed would be successful in the often in spite of the misgivings of From the piano roll to the technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever products they believe the public will pay innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest regulatory NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious few and consequently we see a rich field of products that interact with from the VCR Plus to for PCs to the The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member No entrepreneur or software author will a whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to the Hollywood studios for Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the or in which technologies are distributed in a form that encourages From like the to operating systems like to consumer applications like the Mozilla Free Software is a powerful force for consumer benefit and commercial The BPDG proposal implicitly bans Free Software DTV applications such as the DScaler and the GNU Radio radio program as these applications are built to be modified by something that is banned under the BPDG The component of the will create and entire class of illegal software abridging the traditional First Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive speech in code form under one of several Free Source The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective a bright line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability when deploying their the end product of the BPDG was a that contained no objective criteria for legal the standard required that new technologies be approved by MPAA member Not the only technologies that were approved by the MPAA and hence the only legal technologies were those produced by the and a group of technology companies that acted as the allies throughout the BPDG This is an harbinger of the sort of regime that the BPDG standard will usher technology companies will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by allying themselves with brokering deals to allow certain technologies and outlaw The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently producing products that increase the value and desirability of new such as A BPDG mandate would subvert the market for DTV Competing companies with DTV technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to market if they failed to assuage the concerns about unauthorized the universe of uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized The ability of the public to make uses of television programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of broadcast from the VCR to the the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate would do to competition and consumer interests can only slow down DTV by driving up the cost of DTV devices while reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would If the public is offered less functionality for more they will not flock to The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool for protecting nor that the Broadcast Flag would be effective in that The existing practice of Internet infringement of broadcast programming analog captures from devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal would not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to determined who can capture analog signal from DTV devices and then suffering only a single worth of before the programming enters the the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag that infringement will undermine business to the point that movies will no longer be available to the reducing the value of DTV is no more than No credible study or undertaken by a neutral has ever been presented to the the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this The public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in industry is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of the US government is being asked to mandate unprecedented regulation of the billion technology sector all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few studio EFF welcomes the oversight of the Broadcast Flag The BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of in a where only those participants the organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its where the invented rules and processes on the fly to suit the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly for their where the press was The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public opinion in its As the FCC considers the Broadcast EFF hopes that it will start setting aside the findings of the BPDG in light of the concerns raised by and as well as organizations including Consumers Consumer Federation of the Free Software Public the Center for Democracy in and the Computer and Communications Industry Thank you for attention in this Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance to Sincerely Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation BPDG An overview of our concerns with the broadcast Letter

doctrine that threatens common Internet activity like search engines and For if a website posted a any by a search engine could be considered a trespass even if it caused no The court of appeal

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/spam026.txt,spam, please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully immediately print it and read twice greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below i am a retired attorney and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal i told him that i would review it and get back to him when i first read the letter i thought it was some wall idea to make money a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not legal my client asked me to alter the letter to make it legal i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right i was curious about the letter so he told me how it works i thought it was a long shot so i decided against participating before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over in cash i didn t believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out letters sure enough the money started coming in it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day after about three months the money stopped coming i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled i was earning a good living as a lawyer but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you there is a lot of stress that comes with the job i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf i decided to try the letter again but this time i sent out letters well three months after that i had totaled i just couldn t believe it i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works he told me that there were a few similar letters going around what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter not five like most others that fact alone resulted in more returns the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make well if you send a letter like this out to be legal you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return so when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name mailing address and address your phone is optional this is the key to the program the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands we will be working together to improve each other s lives follow the simple instructions below exactly and in less than three months you will receive over guaranteed a immediately send to each of the seven people listed below wrap the dollar in

cybermart po box linden tx kln s e ave tulsa ok w f h po box butler nj m bird shenandoah ave san marcos ca mtc hartack ct baltimore md jtk po box st petersburg fl b remove the name next to at the top of the list and move the rest of the names up on position then place your name in the spot this is best done by saving this to a file and entering in your information on line be very careful when you

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham324.txt,ham, two weeks ago i posted the following query a system of articles is an innovative feature of a number of languages are there any examples of languages that have lost their articles i would also be interested in creoles especially say if both all source languages had articles but the pidgin creole turned out lacking them thanks to the following for responding lars borin david gohre john e koontz jeff marck deborah d kela ruuskanen achim stenzel shigenori wakabayashi dave wharton of the replies only one was an actual response to my query lars borin lars borin ling uu se pointed out that finnish romani is a language which has lost its articles completely the loss is almost certainly due to finnish influence as are many other traits of modern finnish romani morphology and syntax moreover as colloquial finnish may seem to developing an article system using the demonstrative se that def and the numeral yksi one indef it is interesting to note that lars has noticed in finnish romani texts that there are forms of the demonstrative pronouns auva this and ouva that which are a reduced phonologically and indeclinable reduced versions of the nominative plural the forms are ala and ola while the nominative plurals of auva douva are written aala doola b used much as spoken finnish e i e perhaps representing the first or maybe second stage in a development from demonstrative to preposed definite article importantly the definite articles used to be o sg masculine i sg feminine and e plural both genders hence nothing like the demonstrative pronouns now let me elaborate somewhat on my reason for inquiring into this matter disregarding massive language contact i e hey this is the way we say things around here and you better start doing so too and or creolization i e ok guys let start all over again we ll begin with lexical categories then if it were the case that there is a universal tendency that languages acquire articles but do not loose them then why should this be so if we take a configurational approach to noun phrase interpretation we could say that articles and hence their semantics are associated with a noun phrase internal functional projection in much the same way as some linguists would assume an association between tense and other verbal inflections and a clausal functional projection in essence i m talking about some kind of a dp analysis since possible noun phrase interpretations differ minimally across languages i guess we would then assume that in languages without articles the functional projection associated with the semantic properties in question would have phonetically empty heads the possible tendency of acquiring articles could then be explained as a strive to fill this these head s with overt elements unfortunately i cannot say that i so far have any reason to be convinced about this line of reasoning but i see any obvious reason to give it up either however i am ready to be butchered i should probably read the following references provided by john e koontz koontz alpha bldr nist gov greenberg joseph h how does a language acquire gender markers pp in universals of human language vol ed jos h greenberg et al stanford ca stanford university press discusses evolution of gender marking from articles and articles from demonstratives see also greenberg joseph h nilo saharan as a stage iii article with a penutian typological parallel journal of african languages and linguistics those interested in definiteness especially with respect to english and finnish should consult the following work provided by deborah d kela ruuskanen druuskan cc helsinki fi chesterman a on definiteness a study with special reference to english and finnish cambridge studies in linguistics cambridge university press it worth reading i ve done it alexander vangsnes university of iceland university of bergen oystein rhi hi is vangsnes foli uib no

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham143.txt,ham, alexis mr writes lydie meunier seems to be asking which comes first sexist language or sexist behavior but there is surely a third alternative that language and behavior evolve together reinforcing each other it is also important to distinguish the question of how some form of language or behavior arose in the first place from that of how it is transmitted to successive generations i would have little doubt that sexist language plays a major role in transmitting ideas which lead to sexist behavior but it is difficult for me to believe that historically sexist language came before sexist behavior you re probably right historically sexist behavior probably came before sexist language yet today we are born in a society already in place and sexist language is likely to influence a child mind and lead to a sexist behavior are we born with a sexist attitude i do believe that many traditions sexism being one of them and perspectives are partially conveyed through language however like you i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together i do believe that historically today sexist interactive patterns are influenced among other factors by sociolinguistic practices during biblical times when a wife had to address her husband as slaves had to address their master or subjects their king this implied that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject i e using a clear rhetoric of authority today conversational dominance by males in our society is not as extreme as during the biblical times but interestingly it is still inherent to discourse and has become the focus of some interesting sociolinguistic research as a matter of fact i moved to the bible belt one year ago i spent years on the east and west coasts in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year originally i come from europe and after observations of interractive patterns among couples around me i came to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious or traditional impact on people life the more sex discrimination is reflected in language use i have also noticed much more instances of sex discrimination in language use in offices i had to go to in the bible belt e g doctor and lawyer offices insurance agencies etc than in other professional offices i visited elsewhere in the u s i found this extremely interesting a i do believe that people in all kinds of cultures themselves believe that men and male behavior are superior in some sense to women and female behavior and i hold that this perception even if it were not accurate is what must matter to us as we discuss sexist language whether the perception is accurate is of no importance in this context why should it be of no importance shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it is what is the point of studying linguistics if it is for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implications revealed by research or could we also use research findings to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously socially acquired schemata studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic he retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural obviously the impact of using a sexist language goes beyond the simple interest of linguistic studies within a certain context personally i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large what is the point of considering discriminatory perspectives as unchangeable or questionable facts whereas we all know that both languages and human psychology have the potential to change b i do not make any necessary connection between oppression of womn and oppression of black people at all i simply used the example of black slavery as an example of the general principle that to admit the existence of a form of oppression practiced by some group by white people does not mean that one must necessarily hate them my point was that i am not a mysandrist just because i accept that men have historically not been very nice to women you are absolutely right hate does not help any purpose nor does it improve communication yet black people needed the cooperation of white people to help them reach a status based on the principle of equality the same applies to females who keep trying to communicate with males and who meet open and understanding men whereas others still believe that sexism is a nonsense political issue brought up by angry feminists before being a political issue it is a serious social issue that needs to be addressed through mutual understanding and respect if males refuse their cooperation some females may end up hating men as a natural psychological reaction simone de beauvoir wrote in her book the second sex that there is no black problem yet a white problem referring the civil right movement in the us in the because so called black issues essentially stem from the whites disciminatory attitudes black problems can be addressed by first revealing the problem of racism and then by educating people to open their mind to differences as an enriching asset to the society not a sign of deficiency likewise women issues are primarily men issues because we are still living in a world which has been historically organized by men who believed in female inferiority whether politically socially or linguistically communication between men and women is therefore the key to social improvement hence the social mission of our research in linguistics considering that language use is a social phenomenon je pense donc je baragouine lydie e

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham340.txt,ham, summary of responses to request for information on judgment fatigue also called syntactic satiation original post linguist list mon jul issn special thanks to the following respondents kimberly barskaitiki tim beasley elizabeth bergman michael bernstein vivian cook joseph davis rianne doeleman karen emmorey suzette haden elgin ted harding stephen helmreich erika l konrad john e limber bruce nevin john robert ross carson t schutze linda shockey william snyder karin stromswold joyce tang boyland anyone i may have missed and anyone who thought about responding but has yet karin stromswold and william snyder have actually investigated this phenomenon i have not read either of their papers yet but i look forward to doing so william snyder snyder psyche mit edu presented a poster on this topic at lsa which was mentioned in rick hudson summary post of july individual interested in dr snyder poster should contact him directly hudson post linguist list fri jul issn summarized the literature available which addresses the difference between linguists and intuitions hudson also mentions but does not cite four references provided by joyce tang boyland regarding satiation effects both syntactic and semantic hudson original post is available from linguist list archives joyce tang boyland response is included below in part ii of post following karin stromswold response karin muddle rutgers edu was my connection to snyder hudson and boyland her post is most relevant to my original query and is included in its entirety below in part ii of post following most responses mentioned the influence of continual or repeated exposure over a period of time either mentioning examples similar to perceptual or semantic satiation such as a effect bergman cook davis doeleman haden elgin harding helmreich limber schutze snyder stromswold tang boyland there are many differences however between the effects of semantic satiation and syntactic satiation or judgment fatigue first semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item see also stromswold post below judgment fatigue in contrast cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence in fact published experiments by nagata show that raters intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation second the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it but that individual attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost not the ability to make sense of the utterance third while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees stromswold snyder as cited in hudson post this is not the case for semantic satiation where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect fourth the scanting out effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli relevant quote posted below conversely subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality with no fatigue effect beyond boredom even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items be they open or closed class items note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously great grammatical or horrible ungrammatical there is a definite influence of marginality an effect which to date i believe no one has explained fifth semantic satiation as well as perceptual fatigue effects is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level this could not be the only reason for judgment fatigue however because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items for this reason it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological chemical neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level at this point i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances incidently while i am not an expert on semantic satiation i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a neurological fatigue perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies many linguists beasley nevin konrad and one anonymous also observed that the longer you stay in linguistics the less you speak english to quote from bruce nevin response a student was once asked in my hearing if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english the reply i think he used to be hudson previous summation further confirms that linguists and do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences this type of drift of linguists judgments may be of interest in its own regard but this type of judgment drift is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address as noted by beasley and konrad it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as weak crossover or island constraints for example may actually alter an individual criteria for grammatical acceptability if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic then one may expect that an individual discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual personal experiences with exemplars of the categories others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized davis nevin or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract davis doeleman nevin this is not the case a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts regardless of the concreteness of the topic with the following qualifications judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli which have not yet been clearly defined but see part ii of post following and by the listener reader focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence other individuals related comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue some such sentences notably sentences involving scope ambiguity may induce confusion but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions for ambiguous or confusing stimuli we say someone should rewrite this sentence it is ambiguous or anomalous when we have judgment fatigue we say i m a monoglot but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical i sure do feel like a native english speaker lastly some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement and actual examples barskaitiki

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham245.txt,ham, i would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva questions about control structures like johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom johnny asked to go to the movies which at least for some native speakers are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics no syntax needed here first it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the unmarked case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause therefore the first option is object control in the case of this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors such as the relative social status of the participants student vs teacher it is relatively unlikely though not excluded that the student will ask the teacher to do something therefore it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation in the case of ask a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request i e the asker the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation going to the bathroom thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of the infinitive complement similarly for a sentence like john asked paula to be assigned for the task which seems to involve control switch i e switch from object control to subject control in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent therefore it implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries well not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theory but in the sense of speech act semantics what seems to at work here is a principle of role identity which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as pragmatic roles we also point out some interesting differences between control in english and german for example that sentences like der polizist bat den saal zu verlassen literally the policeman asked to leave the room can only be interpeted as involving an implicit controller i e an addresse or a set of addressees which is not lexicalized related issues are also discussed in my recent book kontrollph im englischen und deutschen aus perspektive published by gunter narr verlag tuebingen by the way koepcke and i found that native speaker intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not klaus panther university of hamburg germany

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/spam000.txt,spam, hi my name is dennis i am a professional hypnotherapist with over years experience i also like many of you spend a bit of time online like you i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches being practical i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people the ones at the front end at the beginning but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other i am sure you know the one i am talking about i know people are still making money with it or there would be so many advertisements but they are making much for two main reasons i can see first it is the same tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head second perhaps more importantly that program doesn t sell anything that people really want they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do care about just so they would have a product to sell i have a solution offer a product that people want to buy i have written clear read reports on most people have things they want to improve about their lives many of these things including stress weight control and smoking can be taken care of with hypnosis but people have good reasons why they do go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them one is cost even though being healthy saves money in the long run people look at the short term expense and decide against it another is pride who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else it is almost like going to a psychiatrist even though it is nothing to be ashamed of it is still something few people want to admit now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves not only will they save money they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves i am sure you have heard someone say before i lost pounds or i quit smoking they are proud of what they have accomplished i keep saying they because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it i am trying to keep this email short but want you to think about something else i have seen multilevel emails that had the following level members with level from each of those level from each of those level from each of those total if they expect that much participation in a program that old could you expect twice the participation per level getting people instead of for each level would make you the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life the fourth shows how to set up your email how to get it out to others and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success i want you to be a success because each person who replies to you asking for report will also be replying to me asking for report then when those people contact customers you will be receiving money and orders from people you did even have to contact they will be advertising for you i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from just think your name is going to be at the position the one that makes the most money when you send out your emails report general information on self hypnosis relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box chepachet ri report weight loss rvp po box wahiawa hi report quitting smoking other uses and tips for self hypnosis s franco po box bonsall ca report turning it into a business j destefano box e university blvd tucson az ordering instructions order each report from the person whose address is under the report title you will need all reports because you will receive orders and money for each one as your name travels down each of the levels each report costs cash imagine receiving of checks a day wondering which ones have cleared and which ones have you can see why cash is a necessity the money should be wrapped in pieces of paper concealing it to prevent theft on one sheet of paper you should include the name number of the report you are ordering your email address and your postal address please write clearly if your email address have parts that can be confused i e vs o l vs i etc please specify which it is the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received it will be sent as an attached document via email unless there is trouble with your email address the postal address will then be used as a backup make sure you save each report as you receive it so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders as i mentioned earlier instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report for now it would be best if you saved this email so you will have it to work with later finally i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business you should treat it as such when you enter it you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make but since it is money you would have had otherwise giving a little of it to uncle sam hurt please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business i can make no guarantees and none should be implied actual profits made may be lower equal to or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter i would wish you luck but i do feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham162.txt,ham, horrid but we must tolerate him Rod Liddle Wednesday August The Guardian Sheikh Abu Hamza our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in Victoria often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public Head for the beach and maybe swing by on the way I had I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the an cone in his one good the waves tickling his and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and maybe me and But and a day at the seaside is probably beyond budget since the Bank of England froze his so Victoria Park had to But he sounded happy enough when I spoke to with the babble of Islamic in the You must know the imam it would by the Daily cartoonist Large metal hook in place of a left One eye covered by a the other a We mock the disabled any more these unless someone like Hamza whom we if excuse the inapt the gloves come So Hamza is known that vaulting imagination typical of the British as in articles which usually call for his or extradition to the or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe off to Pakistan or where he fought the Russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities just out of And if we lock him up or chuck him out of the maybe we can force him to shut Because we like Hamza very We that fond of him before September but in that paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall our disapprobation turned into political And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory urging warfare on and looting of enemies of All out of and a very long time says the not unduly But perhaps he should because our reputation for and tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Hamza or at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque earlier this the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory I know Charity Commissioners were meant to do stuff like He has had his passport seized and not his assets have been He is tailed by the police every now and and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the And this last point is we tell endlessly repeating the mantra over and over and fervently wishing it to be true Hamza is not of British as if British Muslims were a homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for And perhaps The trouble in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more than the list of those Muslim spokesmen who were I suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the An opinion poll commissioned by Radio Today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George One in six to put it ambivalent about the attack on the US remainder condemned the attack A large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against Which is what Hamza But it was something at the we want to if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across at least as someone from the liberal No war against Britain to become independent of US foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab stronger action against mistrust of global redistribution of Nor is he particularly so far as I can although I suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this In the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful for the message of condolence when a London synagogue was Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully he without rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in His ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of he would be in a truly Islamic to stone women to death for for You and I would find many perhaps most of his views utterly And the Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be Multiculturalism is the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling That is a sort of syncopated Multiculturalism the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture and maybe learn from The FBI has been investigating of has found nothing remotely The real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population This is a perfectly noble but it does not You defuse a difficult situation by pretending it And if British Muslims maybe a maybe not feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign it is not because they have been led in that direction by Shutting the man make a It is rather as Louis MacNeice had The glass is falling hour by the

is real pass this up lightly and you ll be making one of the most grave mistakes of your life read this twice please accept my apology if this was sent to you in error you are about to make at least in less than days read the enclosed program then read it again hi my name is jessy lemieux and i am the one who sent you this if not someone i sent this to decided to leave my statement first let me assure you that this is real i am a senior in high school in victorville ca just an average person just as you probably are but am already beginning to become wealthy beyond what i have ever dreamed i can understand if you dont believe me right now but i urge you to take a little time to read this and maybe think about it for a few days that s what i did i recieved this same about two months ago i was skeptical but after some consideration i decided to go for it i decided that the needed to start was worth risking besides if it was a scam i was going to go to the police with the addresses below and get the guy running it busted so that he couldn t rip off anyone else well to my surprise i received my reports you ll find out about those later within two weeks via soon i got a po box and a list of two million all very easy and started sending emails through a bulk email program i downloaded everything was easy after that and the cash was rolling in and thats my story i have no reason to lie to you my address is below and the last thing i want is hate mail for the rest of my life if you are still concerned write me and i will answer any questions you have this truly is the opportunity of a lifetime don t let it pass you by sincerely jessy lemieux pres w o w incorporated dear friend the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is christopher erickson two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business i truly believe it was wrong for me to be in debt like this at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share my experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via email six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not one claimed i make a million dollars in one year it did tell me i have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december of i received this program i did send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i could believe my eyes here was a phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further in debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out emails it only cost me about for my time the great thing about email is that i did need any money for printing to send out the program only the cost to fulfill my orders i am telling you like it is i hope it does turn you off but i promised myself that i would not anyone no matter how much money it cost me in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report by january i had received orders for report when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that you must receive to orders for report within two weeks if you don t send out more programs until you do my first step in making in to days was done by january i had received orders for report if you go back to the guarantee you must receive or more orders for report within two weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have orders the rest is easy relax you will make your goal well i had orders for report more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march of my emailing of i received with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it wont work if you do try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it does work you ll lose out on a lot of money report explains this always follow the guarantee to orders for report and or more orders for report and you will make or more in to days i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i m sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what bills look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for ten years then in my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it was working finally i figured it out it was me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since i do have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program i have already made over four million dollars i have retired from the program after sending out over programs now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas by the spring we wish to market the internet by a partnership with america on line follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to email a copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out and your name will be on every one of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money definitely get back what you invested any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in it works paul johnson raleigh nc here s how this amazing program will make you let say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we ll assume you and all those involved send out programs each let also assume that the mailing receives a response using a good list the response could be much better also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of but continuing with this example you send out only programs with a response that is only orders for report those people respond by sending out programs each for a total of out of those people respond and order report those mail out programs each for a total of the response to that is orders for report those send out programs each for a total the response to that is orders for report that five dollar bills for you cash your total income in this example is for a total of remember friend this is assuming out of people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out programs instead of only believe me many people will do that and more by the way your cost to participate in this is practically nothing you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free report will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists this is a legitimate legal money making opportunity it does notrequire you to come in contact with people do any hard work and best of all you never have to leave the house except to get the mail if you believe that someday you ll get that big break that you ve been waiting for this is it simply follow the instructions and your dream will come true this email order marketing program works perfectly every time email is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this method of advertising

into business get into investments retire or take a vacation no longer will a lack of money hold you back however very few people reach financial independence because when opportunity knocks they choose to ignore it it is much easier to say no than yes and this is the question that you must answer will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it if you do nothing you have indeed missed something and nothing will change please this material this is a special opportunity if you have any questions please feel free to write to the sender of this information you will get a prompt and informative reply my method is simple i sell thousands of people a product for that costs me pennies to produce and email i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money this is not a chain letter or pyramid scam at times you have probably received chain letters asking you to send money on faith but getting nothing in return no product ever not only are chain letters illegal but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive you are offering a legitimate product to your people after they purchase the product from you they reproduce more and resell them it simple free enterprise as you learned from the enclosed material the product is a series of four financial and business reports the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced emailed to the requester best wishes with the program and good luck it was truly amazing not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this program but conservative as i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way that i could not get enough orders to at least get my money back boy was i ever surprised when i found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders i will make more money this year than any ten years of my life before mary riceland lansing mi tips for success send for your four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in when you receive a order you must send out the product service to comply with us postal and lottery laws title sections and specifically state that a product or service must be exchanged for money received while you wait for the reports to arrive name your new company you can use your own name if you desire get a post office box preferred edit the names and addresses on the program you must remember your name and address go next to report and the others all move down one with the fourth one being bumped off the list obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you receive the information on mailing list companies in report decide on the number of programs you intend to send out the more you send and the quicker you send them the more money you will make after mailing the programs get ready to fill the orders important always provide service on orders you receive make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible your guarantee the check point which guarantees your success is simply this you must receive to orders for report this is a must if you do within two weeks email out more programs until you do then a couple of weeks later you should receive at least orders for report if you do send out more programs until you do once you have received or more orders for report take a deep breath you can sit back and relax because you are going to make at least mathematically it is a proven guarantee of those who have participated in the program and reached the above havereached their goal also remember every time your name is moved down the list you are in front of a different report so you can keep track of your program by knowing what people are ordering from you it s that easy really it is remember he who dares nothing need not hope for anything invest a little time energy and money now or search for it for the rest of your life ps from jessy lemieux if you have decided to participate good for you i wish you good luck just one thing though whatever you do don t give away the reports i know its tempting to give them to your friends and relatives i almost did but then i began to think what would happen if everyone gave away just reports do the math and you ll find out that it could cost the people involved literallty hundreds of thousands of dollars would you want someone to cheat you that way it seems harmless but is very damaging to this near perfect system as long as everyone follows the system everyone will be rich sorry if this seemed like common sense to you its just that excited people like me sometimes don t think about things like this and i wanted to make sure that no one gets cheated out of the work they put into this once again good

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham024.txt,ham, are there many languages with contrastive vowel length which dont represent vowel length in the writing system this does happen when someone with a poor understanding of the language devises a writing system for it from outside or when a vowel length language adopts a writing system from a length language but i would be interested to hear of cases of indigenous writing systems that ignore such an important aspect of phonology the reason for my interest is korean it is often said to have contrastive vowel length at least in certain and yet it does not show it in the script the fact it doesnt coupled with the fact that native speakers have difficulty picking which word has the long vowel seems to me like an argument for treating the distinction as one of accent or stress rather than vowel length but the argument depends on how common it is for writing systems to ignore vowel length what do people think reply to me and i ll make a summary of responses if there are several thanks helen hfraser metz une edu au helen fraser dr dept of linguistics university of new england armidale nsw australia phone fax

Array of Independent or Array of Inexpensive No They both point to the same theory and practice in data storage kernel configuration section talk first about the principles behind a RAID RAID uses multiple discs for increased data or data there are levels of RAID in and Linear RAID uses two or more appending data from one to In other when disc is disc steps in to store There is no redundancy in Linear RAID only an increase in storage no marked increase in data access speed because accessing one drive in the RAID array at a data across the RAID Some data will be written to the first some to the Like Linear provides no Because the data has been written in parallel across the not all data exists on all Lose a drive and your data is decrease data access Your system will run more unlike Linear and provide data This is the first level in which data is across the drives in the RAID All data that exists on one drive exists on all the requires at least two drives and they should be of equal your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest Performance with can actually be slower than with a single drive or as all the data is written across multiple for the most pretty It reserves one disc for information while striping the data across the This is much like Linear with an additional disc thrown in for parity Parity data be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other but this really a redundant method of data is probably the least used of the RAID is designed for or more discs and provides both redundancy and Like pays close attention to parity rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this written across the Because the parity data is written across the data recovery can be accomplished fairly In using a configuration will allow to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a Because of increased speed and is probably the most common setup for multiple storage With all that in need to make a choice

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham257.txt,ham, i recently asked as i do periodically if anyone knows of speakers who have different vowels in rider and writer i e who have canadian raising so called for the diphthong ai but who use the vowel of rider in the second syllable of typewriter i received a fair amount of mostly irate comments from people who thought this was impossible however i have found one speaker who happens to be a linguist but not a phonologist who has this pronunciation as it happens he is not from ontario but from illinois but i believe that his existence strengthens the case for the hitherto purely hypothetical account i have proposed of how joos came to invent the ontario dialect in which supposedly writer and rider were homophonous a careful reading of joos shows that the only example he actually cites is typewriter not writer i thus believe that there must have been more speakers who said writer with a higher vowel but both rider and typewriter with a lower one than my sole informant and that this sporadic pronunciation is what led to the birth of the whole myth about rule ordering in canadian english which persists till now as the example of crucial rule ordering in the phonological literature it may not be as glamorous as the eskimo snow word myth but there it is

equivalence west martin l west textual criticism and editorial technique applicable to greek and latin texts b g teubner further information i gathered i was told that what i called textual criticism is nowadays more commonly referred to as scholarly editing another reference brought me to the interpreting ancient manuscripts web at http www stg brown edu projects mss overview html which is devoted to new testament textual criticism and was very helpful indeed although i am confident that a thorough reading of at least some of the sources will no doubt broaden my horizon and deepen my understanding immensely my curiosity about the translation of philosophical texts still remains largely unsatisfied for the moment to clarify what this curiosity is all about here is what i consider to be peculiar to and characteristic for the translation of philosophical texts say some generalized observation from my specific situation as translating ancient indian and tibetan philosophical texts the temptation of consistency once a text is acknowledged as being a philosophical work it is invariably presupposed that it is consistent coherent and thoroughly rational the author is not supposed to make statements unless some assumptions of the philosophy in question provide an explanation for these while this presupposition is necessary and adequate to a certain extent it tends to yield rather questionable results when uncritically combined with the temptation of evaluation or the temptation of justification especially when translating philosophical texts from foreign exotic cultures the translation does not only present itself as a translation but also as an argument why the text in question merits translation in the first place in other words because of the marginalization of exotic philosophy in the introductory classes of philosophy i got to hear at university i was still told that there is no philosophy to the east of greece a translation has to justify its appearance by justifying that the translated text contributes to a presupposed universal philosophy in a relevant manner this is highly problematic for various reasons the specific factor i have in mind however is that when a translator has decided upon translating an exotic philosophical text the value and content of the text are beyond questioning its philosophical character and quality are presupposed to an extent which can severely damage and undermine the very project of translation mistakes which the author made statements which would render the text less valuable for comparative philosophy are tacitly corrected read deleted terminology is adjusted etc this phenomenon itself is grounded in the personal union of translator and historician translator and interpreter translator and commentator while a translation of a novel can be done by one person who is a translator in a more technical sense and can be thoroughly researched in its historical impact by somebody else who is a this is not only uncommon in the field of comparative philosophy or the study of other cultures philosophies but also hardly feasible for in most cases even the philological constitution of the texts in question has to be informed by the interpretation this results in a quite difficult and peculiar position of translation in the whole hermeneutical process in most cases the translation will serve as a commentary to the translated texts not presenting an otherwise inaccessible philosophical text in its own right to those who do not understand the but a justifying the constitution of the text b clarifying the interpretation on part of the translator and c see above justifying the project of translation for those who not only do understand the but who are already basically familiar with the historical and philosophical environment in this context translation loses much of its mediating function between two languages but becomes a tool of explanation which in some contexts can even be dismissed with i have seen and heard many specialists in indian philosophy whose explanations are basically made up of sanskrit terms only vaguely connected by english copula while this can naturally be explained on account of different target audiences translations for specialists will be different from translations for i find that this different function of translation is not recognized within the specialists group at all in other words criteria which would apply to judging a translation in a broader context e g a translation of a novel are applied to translations which are carried out in this specific context without even considering a possible difference in the pragmatic environment i would thoroughly appreciate any opinions on this birgit kellner institute

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham386.txt,ham, in linguist and a parallel query to the corpora list rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ldc before these queries appeared a response to an earlier query from dr salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr salkie as well we have also placed a sample of out of parallel documents each in english french and spanish in ftp ftp cis upenn edu pub ldc data samples un par sample tar z these samples should also be accessible along with quite a bit of other ldc information from the www page at url http www cis upenn edu ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs since dr salkie message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money both in the case of the un corpus and another not yet published ldc parallel text corpus the canadian hansard the ldc membership fee for a university is and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus but also the other twenty or so databases published this year for the same amount a university can get the un corpus and the other databases published in whether a particular database or collection of databases is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement we feel that which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip is not out of line even for university researchers speaking for myself i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years including the acl dci the eci disk the celex disk and others offered in the range of these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc however volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities and of course ldc supplied cash as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization depends on income from somewhere the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture without it the ldc would not exist and neither would either of the databases under discussion to highlight the point the history of the u n publication is worth reviewing briefly we decided to try to publish the u n archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides we paid for a nj based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a wang word processor onto cartridge tapes this required several months and cost a considerable sum we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility then came six of work at the ldc we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set typographical codes and file structures we the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format and published a certain number of s in this form for the purposes of the un this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data then we translated the documents into with sgml markup including a working dtd for those how care and worked out the correspondences among documents this was far from trivial since each un language had been entered separately with no coordination of file names file dates or even division of documents into files and there were tens of thousands of documents per language this work was mainly done by dave graff whose salary the ldc pays we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake we subsidize our members by with government grants or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus which dr salkie also mentioned the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u n material and the same remarks about subsidies apply whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste but as a matter of simple arithmetic the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred for those who have read this far i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc if you are interested in publication of a database that is plausibly of interest to our membership and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish we will pay the costs of production using your label design or one worked out with you we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs the copyright if any will remain with you and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary sending the signed licenses to you we have published several databases on this basis and are planning to publish several others although from past experience the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even best wishes mark liberman myl unagi cis upenn edu williams hall university of pennsylvania phone philadelphia pa fax

in day out but we make no attempt and if any very little to help irradicate a i d s famin the homeless cancer child abuse victims of rape and incest violence and corruption world wide and do forget the environment it a total disaster panamanian offshore banks require as little as usd in paid in capital to qualify for bank registration your usd investment or more can lead you to an unlimited return here some mathematical logistics you take people together each investing usd that makes usd we go to panama and register for public listing so all our shareholders can each get shares each at per share if all goes well and the securities commission accepts the public listing we go to step step we go to the banking commission and apply for a bank license and upon approval you ve got your bank owned by shareholders each holding shares and can be traded freely and we can apply for a listing on the panamanian stock exchange or any other exchange therafter let look at the example below to see how power can be in numbers the minimal interest paid out for example sake is anually on that gives a return of is usd now let go back to reality if you take usd and if your lucky your bank will give you at most a annual interest rate that gives you a return of usd now let recap we have shareholders who invested usd each and at the end of a year each shareholders shares have made a substantial return the exact return for this example is the return on usd at annual interest which is usd divided by shareholders and each of your shares has just incresed by divided by shares cents you ve gained times the return compared to the return your bank would have given you after a year now this is a very bad example because banks deal with daily currency trades bankers acceptances treasury bills government bonds gics stocks mutual funds credit and debit check cards loans lines of credit mortgages and daily transaction fees but the example above gives you a clear picture that alone you do not have the potential that a mere people have and with a group you see that your profit potential is much greater because your total capital is much greater and gives you more opportunities and greater flexibility with banks making record profits of billion and over a year and with unjustified service charges we would like to present a new way of battling this service

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham241.txt,ham, summary of question about numbered examples etc in word for windows first of all i want to thank all those who showed me how to number examples in word and gave me other advice secondly i want to apologize for not mentioning that i was referring to windows programs and not mac programs most people who wrote figured that one out probably from the version numbers in what follows my comments are in square brackets this was the original question i am thinking of moving migrating from wordperfect to ms word which came bundled with my new computer and would like to know if people with similar experiences have anything of interest to say about such a move such as for example any good references to look into that are not too basic the software did come with a reference manual just the online manual two specific questions numbered examples wp can set up counters which is how i dealt with numbered examples word does seem to have a similar capability could that be possible how do people deal with automatic numbering of examples in word as well as to examples file manager this is something where wp is better than word by a long shot but i understand there are for word out there has anybody heard of this search software while i m at it i just got a message about a software utility called powersearch by commtech which has powerful search mechanisms and works in word or wordperfect there are two versions has anyone had any experience with this it is obtainable with ftp windows vs mac there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even i m not ready to change though i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much you do say whether you re a mac or pc person but the reviews of word for mac were uniformly enormously negative they actually ported woindows onto the mac since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully we imaging why they did that the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now and if you are evern going to use alien scripts there no substitute but you shluld also look at framemaker abvailable for lots of platforms ioncluding windows it can number an idefinitely large number of different series between chapters that are separate files etc it only is woldscript sensitive version was sort of but was buggy and in the version they abancdoned it wordperfect vs word the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports though the special fonts that come with wp which are true type will work i believe with word so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends i am in a similar situation my new office computer came with microsoft office which includes word i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word i have about abandoned the idea the main reason for me is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters which i use a lot they include several foreign alphabets most of the ipa alphabet characters for logical notation and so forth word as far as i can tell comes with hardly any of these so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use numbered examples word can indeed number examples or anything at all the terminology is a bit different though which is why i was confused in wp you set up counters but in word you set up sequences several people told me that they had gotten this to work though they did all know how they did it however after they pointed me in the right direction i was able to figure it out you set up a counter by using the seq field look in your manual under fields fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect they have links to things like counters chapter number section number or dates file names etc one of the fields is seq a chose insert field click seq which will give you a seq in the bottom window add ex n to the right of the seq code in lower window press return the ex is the name or identifier for the counter the n is to increase the number by the first time you do this a will show up the second a etc you can set up more than one such counter sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier there are many predefined sequences e g seq chapter refers to chapter numbers b you can create a macro which then you can assign to a button or a key combination which does choose a paragraph type you ve created which has the right margins font size etc for your example paragraph and right tab the stuff in a above left tab c cross referencing examples very easy first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to a highlight the number created in a above along with the parentheses b choose edit bookmark give the bookmark a name characters e g donkey sentence c when you want to refer to it you type e g as we saw in example then you click insert cross reference click bookmark click the name of the bookmark click insert of course many of these operations can be simplified with macros there are many possibilities that i have mentioned for instance if you want to number the examples in ch in the format all you have to is before you insert the field for seq you insert the field for the chapter help on numbering in word came from numbering examples in dos you are right the automatic numbering of examples in word is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as to examples in the text the name of the program is renumber and you can get it by writing to jonathan mead no spaulding ave los angele ca usa or by jonathan at uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are for student and for non student i have used renumber in the past and it works well it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for searching try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of regarding your earch question there is a lot of stuff available out there depending on the scope of your intended use if you re just going for personal use on pc you may want to look at eclipse find not free but only last time i looked just my powersearch seems to be pretty nice i downloaded it from simtel ftp oak oakland edu cd simtel winword or cd simtel wpwin and get the compressed binary file powersch zip or searchwp zip unfortunatel this version has the powerful features locked and to unlock them you have to send in which i have not done the search possibilities seem pretty impressive trees huge advantage if you would make use of it is that you can easily draw trees using the integral drawing program from what people say it sounds better than arboreal i keep a little file of reference books i should say that the microsoft office professional which came wih my computer does have all the manuals in it af first i was too excited about these electronic books but now that i ve gotten used to the idea it not so bad books i have borland running word it is fairly adequate but it does not explain about styles and templates sufficiently to my mind admittedly somewhat addled and it does not have enough information about long documents master documents the index is useless until you already know what you want to find out the help system is extensive though again it is sometimes hard to know what to ask it depending on your learning style you may be quite handicapped without a real manual but happily there are commercial versions available at most bookstores prima visual learning guide for word prima publishing po box rocklin ca is an example on the other hand it is good to get used to the help because it always there file managers what do you want to do delete files view files create directories windows file manager while not the best option offers much of this function just a mouse click away also try word find file command under the file menu i was real happy when i figured out how to do this one i knew you could look at a file in wp without opening it but i was not sure how to do this in word here how from the file menu choose find file select the file whose contents you want to view if you do see the file you are looking for search for it click on the search button choose the drive and directory s you want to look in make a wildcard filename like rev choose include subdirectories if you want to check your whole drive etc click on ok and look at the list of files found to preview the file select preview in the view box still in the find file dialog box then just click on the filename you want to look at and you will see the first page on the screen you can scroll through it to browse you can delete copy open etc by choosing the commands button jon aske home address bates college

transforms your computer into a personal mail server with no additional hardware ems software will give you complete control of your mailings because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient since the mail originates from your computer it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider mail server when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs they work by uploading your mail to your provider mail server they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization this is considered theft of service the problem is the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them many times this causes a provider mail server to bog down and crash obviously this will make providers furious with you furthermore you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages unfortunately most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server you are lucky to get of that mail delivered with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece there is a delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet we did say delivery rate to any internet email addresses a bold claim but it is true this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go it can go to any email address you want with ems ems can work with any dial up internet account aol is not considered a dial up internet account an isdn line or a t or t it runs on windows or nt we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp internet service providers is people try to send as much mail as they can as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp this happen with ems software since you do since you do use the mail server of the isp to send your mail the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer which is now a bona fide mail server to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list you do not have to forge headers or randomize anything to have of your mail delivered although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers you can send mail omitting the to from and reply to portions of your headers want to send out your messages in color this is not a problem with ems just select a font color with your mouse and then click on a background color as well want to make your font bold or put it into italics just point and click want your message centered or shifted left or right once again just point and click unlike all of the others which are all the same but go by different names this software is very straightforward and easy to use if you can log on to aol you already know more about computers than you need to use ems we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have ems works with any windows or nt computer it requires no additional hardware or software the ems software sends at speeds up to messages per hour delivered using a modest

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham265.txt,ham, since victor raskin kindly kept me supplied with the responses he received to his july query about the westfield accents petition i was unusually well prepared to respond when a reporter meredith phoned me july to ask if i had an opinion as a linguist on the matter when i told her about the linguistnet discussion of it she was quite surprised and interested to learn of the existence of such a thing and it turned out her ediotr was too and the result was an article which is as much about linguistnet as about accents the first such that i know of i contacted victor to get his permission to use what i gotten from him but of course neither of us could contact quickly enough the many linguists whose responses i was faxing to the newspaper i figured and victor agreed that messages sent to linguistnet are more or less public and that in any case this was a very good and positive opportunity for us to do some educating of the public which we are always looking for opportunities for i certainly hope everyone who was quoted in the article agrees that i did the right thing in making the linguistnet discussion available to the reporter i think the reporter did a good job of it here the text of her article springfield mass union news westfield edition friday july p linguists criticize accent position by meredith westfield victor raskin a linguistics professor at purdue university in indiana was quite perplexed when he saw an article in his local newspaper about westfield petition to prohibit instructors with accents from teaching elementary school students has anybody else seen a weird piece in the newspaper about a measure taken by the greek mayor of a small massachusetts town with a very ethnically mixed population to prevent people with foreign accents to be employed as grade school teachers raskin asked subscribers to a linguistics computer network this week besides killing my own chances of ever teaching grade school over there is this measure nonsensical linguistically he queried responses to raskin question have been coming into the computer network called linguistnet all week some from as far away as the netherlands and australia and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition which has also been chastized by education officials including the state secretary of education as unfounded and racist the school committee curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee attorney told them it was legally unenforceable the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled the petition organizer laura lee whitten had no comment on the subcommittee decision meanwhile the eight linguists who called into linguistnet on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible network subscriber barbara partee chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher she said wednesday young children almost universally pick up their accents from their peers she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country they would find that the children have not adopted their parents accent many others agreed i used to live in boston where you can cut the local accent with a knife and played the organ for a church in arlington mass where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest craig thiersch a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said but all their children had strong towny accents my own rather limited experience is that children are influenced by the foreign accents of their parents much less their teachers echoed university of georgia professor michael a covington kids get their accents from their peers agreed susan ervin tripp from the university of california at berkeley while the linguists roundly criticized the petition some said they could understand why some parents signed it noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors they acknowledged that a teacher english should be understandable but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor they said my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition partee said she said at umass foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent end of newpaper article in the same paper there was a nice column by william raspberry much of it repeats things we ve been over on the net i extract here a bit from the ending as one who was taught french by a german accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of consonants and wowels i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard and who determines it how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin where is the universal principle kant might not want to hear this but the principle is the problem a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat she listen make some judgment as to whether a teacher accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment she might not even be able to tell you in close cases what tipped the judgment one way or another but would that really be so awful only if you try to make it a kantian universal make it a principle and you re stuck with language panels ethnic spokespersons teachers union reps and of course lawyers before it over people will stop speaking to each other across racial or ethnic lines and everybody will be working to get everybody else fired or defeated for the problem of course will remain unresolved as they say in massachusetts or would if they thought of it some things can be addressed in terms of the philosopher universal law some kant

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham352.txt,ham, dear linguists i ve been following the discussion about snowy words here and elsewhere for some time now and i but disagree with douglas j glick see in two points for one i do find the discussion relatively uninteresting it is interesting indeed to see what kind of ideas about the issue as such and linguistics in general tonguesters or is l more p c put forward it so happened that i encountered this nice passage in a book i bought a few days ago whereas english has only one word for snow or two if we include sleet eskimo has several trudgill this is a book written for the general audience by a native speaker of english who has been a lecturer in the department of linguistic science at the university of reading since op cit and it is twenty years old but you sometimes still hear assertions like the above and i know the same thing from german speakers still in german we have at least schnee schnee mann regen matsch schnee flocke neuschnee harsch waechte lawine loipe hagel graupel and for english snow snow bank fort house man rain flake storm slush snow snow cornice avalanche blizzard dusting flurry frost hail hardpack igloo pingo powder sleet in these lists i m including some at least seemingly semantically transparent compounds like neuschnee new snow schneeregen snow rain and so on as well as some words that are only frosty and not very snowy as well as some that have only to do with snow and nothing else in a serious collection the data should be much richer in order to have a borderline between good and bad examples fall well within the field allow an assessment of the fuzzyness of this line and perhaps discover some model for the cognitive structure of the words in question the data for the english list is apart from some editing taken from tony woodbury posting see granted not everything white in the listings given is snow how can we comment on the quotation above at least the writer should have told the reader why so many snowy words of english do not count as snow or perhaps that eskimo in his opinion has no cover term where english does have one as it stands however it should make everybody very cautious about obtaining data of any language including obviously their own by way of secondary sources likewise how much do the manymany facts drawn from exotic i e not very well documented languages count which for example phonologists like to decorate their elaborate articles with two i do really get the point in excluding words like cornice from a snowy list now if there are people out there who use the word primarily to denote some sort of snow formation and feel the word is in its architectural meaning of rather metaphorical nature what the point in telling them they re really wrong in german waechte flocke and harsch might very well be derived from some other morphemes in fact this only tells us eskimo is not very well documented i guess a lot of those words the hoax claims as semantically primitive would turn out much more connected to the rest of the vocabulary had we only the relative wealth of historical data we have for the indoeuropean languages back to german again flocke to me primarily denotes not something flaky but rather precisely a snowflake and all other usages seem to be derived from that harsch seems to be connected with harsch harsh but used as a noun what other denotation but that kind of slighly melted and frozen snow does it have loipe is the kind of tracks skiers use in their discipline and i guess not a very german word but disregarding borrowed words is just as silly as looking down on adopted children anyway there seems to be a need for that word it snowy very specialized and for my feeling totally unconnected with any other word in german of course i might be totally wrong and loipe is derived from ski laufen to run to ski now there the point linguists are looking on the one hand into history to find out what really happened and try to extrapolate people minds to describe what really going on if there someone with a lot of waechten and cornices and flakes on his mind but with no connection to other words for him this is a fact of that ideolect of course as soon some linguist comes along and tells him the historical truth behaviour and concepts of the speaker might change even if in fact it was some sort of he absorbed when listening to the linguist folk etymology is there because it is a way we can imagine things to be so what layer of this person brain is it that synchronic word counting is claiming to acount for and how historical a derivation is allowed or necessary in historical linguistics finally i would like to point out that apart from some pretty specialized words having to do woth snow rain is another phenomenon languages may have more or less to say about in german for example you have niesel and nieselregen denoting a very light rain or spray there seem to be no other uses or compounds for this word apart from es nieselt however and no immediately related more basic word niesel could be said to be derived from so we have wasser regen niesel and more eskimo does appear that much outlandish any more does it quotation taken from trudgill peter sociolinguistics an introduction penguin books wolfgang lipp castor zedat de sakura kudpc

complete control of your mailings because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient since the mail originates from your computer it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider mail server when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs they work by uploading your mail to your provider mail server they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization this is considered theft of service the problem is the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them many times this causes a provider mail server to bog down and crash obviously this will make providers furious with you furthermore you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages unfortunately most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server you are lucky to get of that mail delivered with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece there is a delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet we did say delivery rate to any internet email addresses a bold claim but it is true this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs this

also control where you want any bounced back mail to go it can go to any email address you want with ems ems can work with any dial up internet account aol is not considered a dial up internet account an isdn line or a t or t it runs on windows or nt we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp internet service providers is people try to send as much mail as they can as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp this happen with ems software since you do since you do use the mail server of the isp to send your mail the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer which is now a bona fide mail server to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list you do not have to forge headers or randomize anything to have of your mail delivered although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers you can send mail omitting the to from and reply to portions of your headers want to send out your messages in color this is not a problem with ems just select a font color with your mouse and then click on a background color as well want to make your font bold or put it into italics just point and click want your message centered or shifted left or right once again just point and click unlike all of the others which are all the same but go by different names this software is very straightforward and easy to use if you can log on to aol you already know more about computers than you need to use ems we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have ems works with any windows or nt computer it requires no additional hardware or software the ems software sends at speeds up to messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a modem rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t they will be even faster if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below we do plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity the cost to you is money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth or the many others like it they all operate the same way for you might be happy with stealth if you do mind frequent loss of accounts and lot of complaints not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings all of which defeated the purpose of in the first place few people are aware of this new technology so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition using this you can sell anything you wish over and over also consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others you ve probably gotten that claim they can send your advertisement for a cost of per what most people do realize is that only or of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered this mailing service is very profitable and using this software you can advertise that service

read this one though you might find this interesting i recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract they messed up but that whole dep t of people including myself are hung out to dry corporate america at it finest i have not had luck yet finding another job as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company during the time i worked there i also bought and sold real estate like those guys on tv yes you can do that and make it work for you too the key is i made it work i was fairly successful until the nightmare on pleasant st as my friends and i call it i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job as you ve already heard i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet so i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me let me tell you i believe some of the things out there what a waste of time until i saw this hold on i know you are like i was ready to stop reading right here i implore you not to i like you am not some fool i have made much money for myself in real estate which is not an easy business i am a rather competent business man at least finish reading this until the end better still print this letter and read it in comfort over and over here is what i saw i only needed extra dollars to try this this is making money for people who at least tried a little so why not me too in desparation i sent the four dollar bills and got the reports as i always have i made this work for me too i took much time and effort to learn about which is a great and free tool and how to send lots of it now days after my first mailing of this i have received roughly responses trust me when my fiance saw dollar bills on the kitchen table she no longer laughed at me for trying this i wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same which i will give to you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success i will show you every step of cutting pasting editing this letter to

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham312.txt,ham, i agree with mark durie that it is less curious that chomsky is cited so much than that others before him are cited so little at least by linguists for example two of the most important issues in multilinear phonology one fairly recent the other around since the are one mapping between tones and vowels and prosodic licensing the notion that elements of one linguistic level must belong to units of a higher level usually the next level up both of these notions are explicit principles of tagmemic phonology on the first cf the last two paragraphs of pike pike then read the first line of the introduction to goldsmith phd thesis for an interesting contrast on the second principle cf pike and his discussion of the phonemic hierarchy one rarely sees pike quoted in this regard e selkirk has long been an exception to this pattern though geoff pullum nllt column on citation etiquette in linguistics takes up this general problem this is partially understandable since a lot of tagmemics insights take the unappealing form of a disjoint set of commentaries on the last language pike looked at nevertheless there is no way to deny that pike is responsible for some brilliant insights into human language and pike is just one example there are plenty of others it is not that anyone needs chomsky to make their work respectable that is clearly false whether the individual is saussure or a student still if anyone were to seriously doubt that it is chomsky not saussure nor bloomfield nor sapir nor even jakobson who put linguistics on the map of the intellectual disciplines and who has done more to keep it there than anyone else is in need of some psychiatric help moreover the fact that chomsky publishes more than any other linguist if i am wrong please correct me that would be interesting does hurt his citation index his output is nearly asimovian his influence on the field can be seen even at the level of university administration when a department chairperson wants to convince a university administrator that linguistics has natural intellectual ties to many departments i do not think that they would drop the names of saussure or pike rather than chomsky it is worth considering the possibility that many of the citations of chomsky work could be due to ignorance if he said it or even if we think he did just cite him and nobody will argue why look for the original source that hard work and laziness too often prevails but it is also true that like it or not the source of many of the most interesting ideas in history on human language came from mit
/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham213.txt,ham, a few weeks ago i asked the following question could somebody please tell me how sri lanka is written and pronounced in spanish is the pronunciation uniform across latin america my reason for asking was that one of my students a peruvian told me it was pronounced esrilanka yet i seemed to recall that a mexican had once told me it was sirlanka as you will see below i was wrong but only partly here are the responses i received en reponse a ton mail sur la prononciation de sri lanka en espagnol je peux dire qu en amerique du sud chili argentine on prononce et on ecrit siri lanka my latin american friends tell me sri lanka is pronounced just as one would expect sri lanka with the r and the velar nasal they say it is spelled as you have spelled it en respuesta a su pregunta sobre la escritura y la pronunciacion de sri lanka en espanol le puedo decir lo siguiente en cuanto a la escritura si no me equivoco se mantiene el original sri lanka sin embargo en cuanto a la pronunciacion existe la tendencia general a intercalar una i de apoyo entre la s y la r siri ello no excluye que ciertos individuos considerandose mas cultos y mas sabios hagan el esfuerzo de pronunciar sri esfuerzo que rompe con la tendencia del espanol de evitar toda s liquida esfuerzo por consiguiente considerado no natural con respecto a la pronunciacion en latinoamerica no puedo decirle gran cosa pero imagino que tambien se ha generalizado la tendecia fonetica a intercalar la vocal i i pronounce it ezri la nka r trill n velar nasal in normal speech in rapid speech the z assimilates to the following rhotic producing a sound of intermediate quality this assimilation is a well known fact of spanish phonetics in nonaspirating dialects described for instance in navarro tomas standard manual in slow speech esri without voicing i am from spain in aspirating dialects it is ehri eri i am from seville spain i write the name of the country as sri lanka and i pronounce it sri lanka i might also pronounce it as esri lanka but this is due to the fact that we do like sequences sc as onsets of words you may have already realized that if you have listened to spanish people speaking english many of the them would say espein instead of spein in argentina sri lanka is pronounced siri lanka the r sound is according to ipa is a percusive sound the n is velar i just called my daughter who is a writer at la jornada a local newspaper she works in the economics section she said that their spelling is just like english although she supposes that some purist publications probably change the k for a c she wrote sri lanka on a piece of paper and asked the people who were in the office to pronounce it she confirmed my own suspicion that people pronounce it as if it were in spanish two of them with a rather marked e at the beginning which is what spanish phonology would require with st for instance the rest of us tend to sonorize the s but that would be expected in mexican spanish anyway so her conclusion and mine we re both speakers of spanish as a lang is that it pronounced normally she has worked with a number of argentine journalists and never noticed that they did anything worth noting which means that they probably pronounce it just about the same from in penaja wku edu juan antonio pena as far as spelling sri lanka is the spanish orthography for this asian country as far as phonetics the only thing worth noting is that we insert an e e sound at the beginning of the word sri spanish does this with all words beginning s any stop consonant in spain the name of the state is written as in english sri lanka the geographical name of the island is ceilan with an accent on the a the pronunciation in tv and broadcasting varies some people says sri lanka some others esri lanka r stands for the multiple trill of rr in spanish the same sound as in perro hear in spain we use to pronounce the name of the old island of ceilan in two different ways the most common pronunciation is esrri lan ka i use double r for the spanish hard r and n for the velarized nasal sound there is another pronunciation not so common as the former siri lan ka i do not know the origin of this one so there you have it my impression is that esrilanka is more common in spain and sirilanka more prevalent in south america but this is obviously not absolute many thanks to all those who responded marc picard

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham004.txt,ham, about a month ago i posted the following query i m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties bare unmarked nouns occur in argument position and may be interpreted as either singular or plural eg malay mandarin japanese as opposed to english at least some determiners are unmarked for number eg english the some john as opposed to this these and most interestingly when a bare unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number the resulting np is marked for number so far i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do satisfy these conditions singaporean malay like in standard malay bare unmarked nouns are unmarked for number eg kucing cat cats again like in standard malay the determiners itu that the and ini this are unmarked for number eg seekor kucing itu that the one cat dua ekor kucing itu those the two cats unlike in standard malay bare unmarked nouns in construction with itu and ini tend to be interpreted as singular eg kucing itu that the cat cats apparently there is some variation here between speakers and between different constructions for the same speakers singlish aka colloquial singaporean english unlike in standard english bare unmarked nouns are unmarked for number eg cat cat cats like in standard english prenominal possessors such as john are unmarked for number eg john one cat john one cat john two cat s john two cats when bare unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular eg john cat john cat cats some questions a is anybody familiar with more such examples references b is this a southeast asian areal feature and or a common pattern c in both of the above cases an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np are there any cases where the result is a plural np d does anybody have any ideas how to analyze explain this phenomenon within any theoretical framework or none this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay japanese thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko and korean thanks to jae jung song in the meantime further field work of my own revealed that in singlish not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article the exhibits a similar singularity effect although unmarked for number as evidenced by the one cat the two cat s the cat is interpreted as singular further observations were provided by steven berbeco richard dearmond bob fradkin mark a mandel edith a moravcsik and gwyn williams

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham248.txt,ham, dear lingustis i am very sorry that i have been convinced that i have already posted my summary of the query on not until i asked you in march i cheked my fd several days ago and found that i compiled several respon ses dated in march but i could not found my summary in any of my fds or hd if i have already posted a summary please do bother to read it again i will defineitely repeat an error again here are my query and summary my query in march dear linguists i read renaat declerck paper titled the problem of not until in lingsuitics he considers that below implies not only that john did wake up before nine but also that he did wake up at nine as late as nine he could have woken up earlier he seems to claim that all types of not until does have such an implication he calls it the sense of acualization he also claims that the sense of actualization is not implicature but assertion what do you think john did wake up until nine my first query is do all types of not until have the sense of actualization what about the sentences below the second query is is the sense of actualization able to be cancelled or suspended by adding such phrases as if not later or possibly later at least please judge whether the sense of actualization arises in each sentence arises or not until nine john did wake up bill did say another word until he died a nancy remained a spinster until she died b nancy did get married until she died b h jcool b i ji told him b h jwhat do you feel b i h jnothing well uh maybe i m exaggerating it was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stakes but le not talk about it abstractly until we re out of here now first question the bottles shall we take them all with us or leave one b i h jtake them b i ji said brown corpus she gave a little pout and said b h ji do get off work until eleven o clock that when my evening commences b i j brown the fact that the queen is expecting a baby will not be official until an official announcement has been made lob nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and ethnic regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material brown his own inner voice which should tell him what not to do has not developed it develop until he has words with which to clothe it brown b j john did stay awake until b j ensign vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs and when night began to fall he put seaman c donald l norton and seaman c william a roch ford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette brown john left until midnight is this really acceptable third query are the following sentences acceptable until nine john did wake up i do know about later for i left at nine in fact i heard later that he did not wake up after nine either john did wake up until nine in fact i heard later that he did wake up at all if you have any comment on this problem i would be very grateful thanks a lot in advance best wishes hiroaki tanaka associate professor tokushima university japan niftyserve or jp to this query those who reponded are the following people i am very grateful to them james kirchner jpkirchner aol com micheal cit cornell edu gerald b mathias mathias uhunix uhcc hawaii edu larry horn lhorn yalevm cis yale edu jack wiedrick varney idbsu edu almost all my sentences seem to imply actualization with the following exceptions is aceptable to many but not all speakers dr horn implies actualization in the sense that mary got married on her deathbed or means at her deathbed she was still a spinster the first reading is less possible than the second about and the below is the part of my paper titled implicature of not until for english linguistics vol forthcoming journal of english linguistics society of japan which i wrote a month ago nia examples and illustrate typical cases with no implicature of actualization nia a john was a loyal member of his party until he died b bill did say another word until he died heinamaki a nancy remained silent until she died b nancy did get married until she died declerck in both examples of death blocks actualization of the head clause john cannot be a disloyal member after his death and bill cannot say anything after his death nia comes from pragmatic real world knowledge declerck assumes that examples like and also are semantically anomalous although he accepts an affirmative sentence like it would be impossible for declerck to accept because he considers that all examples of not until must be associated with the sense of actualization i e not until presupposes the truth of actualization so that declerck forcibly matches his analysis with data but not until x died does exist as in an acceptable sentence like in which case say another word means b h jexpress in words b i j although is also semantically anomalous in the sense of b h jutter pronounce b i j besides some of my informants accept those who find unacceptable must account for the difference between and one solution is that we will let nip work on the one hand as in and will not let it work on the other as in but this solution is ad hoc the other is that the difference lies in our pragmatic knowledge even though one cannot say anything after his her death s he can leave something other than his her words i e negation of saying something does not always imply saying nothing one can leave his her message will or anything else hence a rare reading of ia people found his will after his death in however one cannot get married after s he dies i e death blocks marriage we cannot imagine the negation of marriage other than not getting married this pragmatic reasoning would be more appropriate have also two meanings i john kept dozing off but at he finally succeeded in keeping himself awake ii john went to sleep before prof james kirchner is only possible in the sense that john was gone for a while and then he came back at midnight prof jack wierdrick i wanted to know that and are the sentences which can cancel the sense of actualization the result is that is acceptable and is unacceptable prof jack wierdrick says that is awkward although the right interpretation could be gotten from it he gave me an example like up until nine at least john did wake up concerning the problem of cancelability dr larry horn cites his examples from his famous dissertaion on the semantic properties of logical operators in english as follows santa claus get here until midnight if not earlier later if then and he may not even get here then he says that in general not until s as opposed to not until np constructions trongly implicate a late bound which can be suspended thank you very much for all the responces i wrote a very short paper about not until which will be publised this fall if you want a copy of it i would be pleased to send it to you by the form of via best wishes hiroaki tanaka faculty of integrated arts and sciences tokushima university japan e mail ias ac jp office niftyserve or jp home

/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham339.txt,ham, a couple of weeks ago i posted a query about an alleged quotation from chomsky the quote came from gordon hewes an anthropologist and a specialist in language origins in his paper language origin theories in duane rumbaugh book language learning by a chimpanzee on page there hewes asserts that chomsky has explicitly attributed the human language faculty to a single genetic mutation in one of our ancestors the source was given as chomsky but no such item appears in hewes bibliography nor indeed any works by chomsky at all i therefore asked if anybody could point to such a statement in chomsky works i received seven responses most of them from people who either know chomsky personally or who take a professional interest either in chomsky work or in language origins no one was aware of any such statement by chomsky either in print or elsewhere and a couple of people flatly disbelieve that chomsky has ever said any such thing i myself have tracked down and read all of chomsky publications which might be relevant and i can find no such suggestion in any of them though two of them do make passing remarks on language origins i have also skimmed through chomsky books cartesian linguistics language and mind and knowledge of language without finding any such statement though i have read them carefully it appears then that chomsky has made no such suggestion and that hewes statement must result from some kind of error or misunderstanding i find this odd though since hewes is well known as a specialist in language origins and since the remark occurs in the middle of a generally survey of earlier suggestions on the origin and evolution of language most peculiar my thanks to keith mccormick robert freidin scott delancey vivian cook rich hilliard massimo piattelli palmarini and raf salkie for their helpful responses larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton england larryt cogs susx ac uk
/home/silviu/Documents/Machine Learning/ML-Spam-filter/public/ham049.txt,ham, about snow first i should apologize to tony for misunderstanding his cocktail advice his derivation of the origins of my misunderstanding is correct second i think that quotations from boas whorf are very helpful and a good reminder to those of us in this debate third as to the question of whether or not sleet is related to snow i do agree it is i agree related and would be defined in relation to water but at least i and a few other students that i asked would define it as a form of snow ditto for freezing rain fourth i agree with tony that counting has to be mediated by many considerations of grammatical structure in the compared languages and spread of the form in the speech community but i do think that this wipes out the admittedly small but original point fifth i m going to sidestep the issue over lexicalization vs complex construction because i do think that i share the same view as others on the importance necessity of this distinction indeed it is a bit ironic that another implication of sapir whorf is that the view that our language is made up out of words and grammar constructions is precisely the kind of objectification which we would expect and which formal distributional analyses show to be a simplification as jonathan states figuring out just what counts as a simple lexicalised form is very hard in yup ik given that it has a rich higly productive derivational morphology i agree and the answer would eventually have to draw lines along continua that i do think will be labelled lexical vs construct and sapir offered some nice theoretical machinery for these kinds of comparative distinctions too i still see only four arbitrary and unmotivated forms that deal specifically with now i e snow slush blizzard flurry i ll leave it to others to decide whether or not various dialects of eskimo have more or less but even if the point should fail here it still has life to it so i still find myself agreeing with the original insight the point and not all that it has been used to argue has always seemed obvious to me perhaps if we narrow the scope of the relevant speech community and bring it closer to home it is easier to see would we all accept the idea that on average lawyers vs have more distinct forms for legal concepts than do others outside this community culture and of course what we mean by distinct forms implies all of the complex relative distinctions hinted at above similarly to take an example i know more about statistically speaking arabs have more arbitrary and unmotivated forms for camels than english speakers even accounting for differences in the structures of the two languages why does this simple and to be honest relatively uninteresting idea seem to bother people so much douglas j glick department of anthropology vassar college doglick vassar edu
